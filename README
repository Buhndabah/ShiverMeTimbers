Project no: 2
Project due date: March 6th, 2014
Project description: Update the project 1 framework with the 5 new classes of the tracker framework.

The Specs that I implemented are:
	1) A viewport into a larger world is provided. The user can track the different objects in the animation by pressing the 't' key.
	2) Three kinds of Sprites are incorporated into the animation (Sprite, MultiSprite, RotateSprite). These are stored in a polymorphic container of Drawable*.
	3) There are mutliple special sprites.
	4) The frameFactory is responsible for handling the animation.
	5) The clock class uses a queue to compute the average fps.
	6) You can adjust virtually all constants and parameters to the animation from the XML file.
		The new parameters you can change in this project are:
			the initial angle of rotation for a RotateSprite
			the change in angle after each update for a RotateSprite
	7) The README is filled in
	8) There are no warnings in the user code.
	9) There are no memory leaks in the user code.

The Specs that I was unable to implement are:

Extras:
 	RotateSprite - a sprite that uses rotozoom to rotate itself based on angles specified in the xml file
	You can toggle the rotation by pressing the 'r' key
		the rotation now correctly does not occur when the game is paused
