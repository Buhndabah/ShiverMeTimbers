Project no: 3

Project description: Introduce a player to the game along with a HUD, and give an illusion of depth.

The Specs that we implemented are:
	1) A modular HUD
		With HUDComponents such as a health bar tied to the player, the average fps message, and a game timer.
	2) A player (of class type gridElement) that is controlled via WASD and the arrow keys
	3) An illusion of depth is created due to our isometric grid.

	4) A newly implemented XML parser based on rapidXML

The Specs that we were unable to implement are:
