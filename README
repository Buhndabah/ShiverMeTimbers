Project no: 4
Project due date: April 15th, 2014
Project description: Pooling, Collisions, smooth player movement, etc

The Specs that we implemented are:
	1) Object pooling (snowflakes)
	2) Grid Element collision detection
	3) Strategy for gridElement AI (following fairy, "bullets"
	4) projectiles
    5) event queue (observer pattern)

The Specs that we were unable to implement are:
    We felt that chunking was inappropriate for our aesthetic, so that was omitted
    Hit detection on snowballs is still a WIP
