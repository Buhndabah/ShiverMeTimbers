 Shiver Me Timbers



Our game will let the player control a pirate penguin that explores a isometric map in search for treasure.
The player will move around the map and try to find and dig up booty with a shovel.
Once all the booty is collected, or once the time limit runs out, the game ends and the player is assigned a score.

However, this isn't going to be a relaxing Easter Sunday egg-hunt.
Other pirate crews will be after the map's booty, and will dig it up for themselves as well as attack our player.

Furthermore, some booty will have special requirements for the player to obtain them.
Certain chests will require the player to find a key on the map, for instance.

Neutral hazards will delay the booty quest of player and enemy alike, such as rock walls, pitfalls, and snowstorms.
